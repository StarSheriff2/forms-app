In this simple form, you can perform operations like Create a new user, edit an existing user or show all existing users in the database.

The purpose of the project was help us learn how to build forms using the form helpers built into Rails, like `form_with` and `form_tag`.

## Built With
- Ruby version 3.0.0
- Ruby on Rails 6.1.1
